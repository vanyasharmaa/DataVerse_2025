    "Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks (predicting one of two outcomes). Unlike Linear Regression, which is used for predicting continuous values, Logistic Regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a certain class. It achieves this by using a sigmoid function (also known as a logistic function) to map any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, which can then be interpreted as a probability.\n",
